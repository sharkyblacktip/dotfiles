# sharky's dotfiles
my overly confusing (and debatably usless) configs
feel free to poke around

I "borrowed" some of [PilkDrinker's dotfiles](https://github.com/PilkDrinker/PilkDots) for hyprland, waybar and other programs.
So go check that out, his dots look real good!

- run `./scripts/link.sh` to symlink files according to `targets.conf` (If you're modifying targets.conf, don't forget to add a newline at the end!)
- run `./scripts/install.sh` to install all relevant programs
